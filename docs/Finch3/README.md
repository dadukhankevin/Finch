#### About

Finch 3 is a genetic algorithm framework. It aims to be:

* understandable
* fast
* and capable

This is a very early version but here are some things you can expect:

* The ability to run genetic algorithms on a GPU
* Much better documentation than Finch2 (although this is a work in progress)
* Overall much faster, more consistent, and far less bugs.

#### Docs

Here are the docs:

https://Finch-1.gitbook.io/Finch3/

Note: They are accurate but horribly formatted (will fix this soon)

#### Colab Notebooks

1: [Simple Finch Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QK7zYTBSkud4V6QQQRCi0ofkJ9bFp9B9?usp=sharing)

* Very simple genetic algorithm

2: [Trick Clip](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q\_MDZAqofAbj-wkZHoWoWSP\_6osymLGK?usp=sharing)

* A genetic algorithm built to create 'adversarial images' against the Clip image recognition model.

Many Google Colab notebooks will be added here soon!

#### Installation

**From Pip**

`pip install finch-genetics`

**From Git**

run `git clone https://github.com/dadukhankevin/Finch`

#### Example

This example demonstrates the usage of Finch3, a genetic programming library, to evolve individuals in a sequential environment.

1.  Import Finch:

    ```python
    from Finch.environments import Sequential
    from Finch.genepools import FloatPool
    from Finch.layers import *
    ```
2.  Define a fitness function `fit` that evaluates the performance of an individual. This is a very simple fitness function, and will essentially help us evolve a list floats to slowly become higher and higher numbers. The fitness function _could_ also simply turn the floats into weights in a neural network and then evaluate their performance, this concept is called neuroevolution.

    ```python
    def fit(individual):
        return sum(individual.genes)  # You can modify the fitness function to make it interesting
    ```
3.  Configure the genetic algorithm parameters in the Config section.

    ```python
    # Config section
    length = 100
    pool_minimum = 0
    pool_maximum = 10
    population_size = 100
    amount_to_mutate = 10
    gene_selection = 5
    parent_count = 20
    children_count = 2
    max_population = 99
    evolution_steps = 1000
    min_mutation = -2
    max_mutation = 2
    ```
4.  Create a FloatPool to define the gene pool for individuals.

    ```python
    # Creating the FloatPool
    pool = FloatPool(length=length, minimum=pool_minimum, maximum=pool_maximum)
    ```
5.  Create a Sequential environment with various layers representing different genetic operations.

    ```python
    # Creating the Sequential environment
    environment = Sequential(layers=[
        Populate(pool, population=population_size),
        FloatMutateRange(individual_selection=amount_to_mutate, gene_selection=gene_selection,
                         min_mutation=min_mutation, max_mutation=max_mutation, keep_within_genepool_bounds=True),
        ParentSimple(parent_count, children=children_count),
        SortByFitness(),
        CapPopulation(max_population=max_population),
    ])
    ```
6.  Run the genetic algorithm.

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Compiling the environment with the fitness function
        environment.compile(fitness_function=fit)
        environment.evolve(evolution_steps)

        # Printing the best individual
        print("Here is the best individual:\n", environment.best_ever.genes)

        # Plotting the environment
        environment.plot()
    ```
